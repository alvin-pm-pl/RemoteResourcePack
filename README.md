# RemoteResourcePack
A plugin to make use of [Resource Pack CDN server](https://github.com/alvin-pm-pl/ResourcePackCDN)

# Introduction

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition introduced a feature that allows client to download resource pack from external URL.

This allows us to have fast resource pack download speed, also
resolving [pmmp/PocketMine-MP#3127](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/issues/3127) without having to modify PMMP.

# Installation
You will most likely don't need to configure anything, but you should have at least 1 remaining port to use this plugin as this plugin binds the port for file server.

If you need to modify webserver port or host, edit config.yml in plugin_data/RemoteResourcePack/config.yml.
